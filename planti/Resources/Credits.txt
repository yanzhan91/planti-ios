<h4>About this app</h4>
<p>
Do you like eating out but worried about your vegan and vegetarian preferences? We have that problem too! So we created the Planti app; the easiest and best way to discover more choices around your location.
</p>
<p>
Rather than just showing the "vegetarian available" option for restaurants, we focus on specific items on the menu that fits to your preference.
</p>
<p>
If you like using our app, please consider contributing new menu items to help other users to discover more options.
</p>
